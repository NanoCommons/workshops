## Your Own Data

Some years ago, the concept of [Bring Our Own Data (BYOD) meetings](https://www.dtls.nl/fair-data/byod/)
was coined. This part of this workshop is basically a BYOD session. In this hackathon you will apply the
approaches of the [previous session](SpreadsheetAnnotation.md) to your own data.

**Importantly**, your data does not have to be a spreadsheet. It can be in a different format too.
Second, the amount of data is not important.

What your data does have to comply with, is the following:

1. it is already published and can be publically shared
2. the data is yours

### Goal of this hackathon

Furthermore, the goal of this excersize is not annotate everything in full detail. That takes more
effort and commonly still results in research papers and projects get European funding to undertake
such efforts. A detailed annotation involves ontological discussions and require you to make
choices

But not today. Today, we focus on how a minimal amount annotation can already make your research easier
to work with in Integrated Approaches for Testing and Assessment (IATA).

With the demo spreadsheet in mind, you will go through the following steps and questions. Write
down your answers: they are basically part of your labnotebooks. Some questions may not (yet) have
an answer. These questions can be asked.

At the ends of this session, we will have plenary step where we will go through the question
with 

## Step 1: what are the key concepts in your data?

 * with what physicochemical properties are your nanomaterials described?
 * what biological experiments did you do? What cell lines or organisms?
 * what units is your experimental data given in?
 * can you find IRIs for all these aspects?

## Step 2: how can your data be made more uniform?

 * do you use a data management plan (DMP)? what file formats does it require you to use?
 * is your data provided in single tables or provided in more than one table?

## Plenary Step 3: Joint Group Reflection/Summary
